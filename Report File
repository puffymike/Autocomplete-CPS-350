a)	One of the known bugs that we found in our program, is that the search bar will only display the matching results of the first
word. For example, if you searched “this”, and a key is “this is”, it will display if typed in “this”, but will not display if 
typed in “is”. The only solution we had was to store the Strings from the file into arrays of strings and then compare them 
accordingly. We saw that you handled most the inputs in the AutocompleteGUI and we didn’t want to mess anything up.

b)	A couple serious problems that we incurred was getting the mouse curser to stay at the end of the word when there were no 
corresponding keys that reassembled the users input. Although, stressful, we were able to find a solution. Another problem we had 
was getting the program to ignore the cases of the inputs and keys, but again we found a solution. Another problem that we 
encountered was when using the cities.txt, the comparisons can’t handle multiple words after the coma. 

c)	We enjoyed doing the assignment but felt that it would have been a better learning experience if we could build the 
application ourselves (Provided with more time)
